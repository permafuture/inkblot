Organic Books is owned by the Brewer family, lifelong book lovers who've lived in Albuquerque off and on since 1977.

**Steve Brewer**, the author of 31 published books, is well-known among local readers and writers. A former journalist, he teaches part-time at UNM's Honors College, including a "Meet the Authors" class. Steve coordinates events at Organic Books, and is regularly at the store to visit with readers and fans.

**Kelly Brewer** brings her skills as a marketer, administrator, event-planner and number-cruncher to the shop. A UNM alum, she is a recovering newspaper journalist and one-time editor of the Albuquerque Tribune.

**Max Brewer** is the resident futurist, coder and carpenter. He is a certified permaculture designer who has also lived in a commune. He writes novels and essays, develops websites and curates book collections.

**Seth Brewer** is the resident philosopher, comedian and spatial engineer. He has a thorough knowledge of how to create and play video games. A newlywed, he's completing his bachelor's degree at UNM this semester.

### Together, they've created a fun bookshop full of bargains and beloved favorites, the Nob Hill destination for people who love books.
