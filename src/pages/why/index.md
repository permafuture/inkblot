Organic Books is a brick-and-mortar store selling paper books. We believe that internet shopping can never replace the sensory delight of a good old-fashioned bookstore.

Millennials are leading a charge for collecting paper books, vinyl music and other experiential media. They also drive the growing market for a "third place" experience – not work, not home, but a comfortable third place place to hang out.  E-reader sales, which captured the 35+ reader for the last 10 years, have reached stasis in the market.

Meanwhile, market share is gaining for indie brick-and-mortar bookstores, rising 30 percent to 40 percent in the United States over the last three years, according to bookseller industry news. 

We have an everlasting love for books, reading and stories--and the people who live and breathe them.  The shop is a book club in itself—the more the merrier.
